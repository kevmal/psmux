# Issue #686 follow up: a psmux command run while another server shuts down
# must not terminate that server halfway through its shutdown.
#
# Every psmux invocation starts by reaping orphaned servers
# (session::reap_orphaned_servers): a psmux process that listens on loopback,
# is older than 10 s, is claimed by this data dir's ownership marker and is
# named by no .port file. shutdown_this_server removes its .port first and
# then waits up to 4 s for spares still inside CreateProcessW. In that window
# the server matched every rule, so any psmux command (another namespace, a
# prompt, a status job) terminated it with exit code 1, and the spares it was
# waiting for became orphan pwsh for ever.
#
# Deterministic: the session is aged past the reaper's grace period, every
# spawn is held 1500 ms (PSMUX_TEST_SLOW_CREATE_MS), and `ls` in another
# namespace runs during the shutdown.
